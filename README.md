# 7 Segment Display

In this project, a simulation is designed that projects the keys pressed on the screen. I used the following devices;

- 8086 Microprocessor
- 8255A for I/OK
- 3X4 KEYPAD
- 2 74273 LATCHES for address
- 2(8K) ROM
- 2(8K) RAM
- 74LS245 DATA BUFFER for data transiving
- 2 INVERTOR
- 4 OR GATES
- CLOCK GENERATOR CIRCUIT



 *Program files and project created with **Proteus software and emu8086**. They should be installed for execute the files.*


*Note: I have prepared  **explanation video** to understanding easly of my project
